This project focuses on exploring the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect emotions in song lyrics across different music genres. Using the "Songs_Lyrics" dataset, which contains over 160,000 rows with attributes like lyrics, genre, artist, year, and song title, the project investigates how emotions vary by genre and how these emotions have evolved over time. The analysis employs the Emotion English RoBERTa Large model, which goes beyond basic sentiment analysis to classify a wide range of emotions. This research also addresses the potential of LLMs in improving mood recognition, sentiment analysis, and emotional feedback in AI systems.
